I just picked up an armor blue object with a triangle symbol in the middle. The object read ¨Visor¨ and it gave me a basic visor vision enhancement as well a blue silhouette on my character. The main change is that the orange ring became blue, and was a lot easier to see into. I don't know if it makes a difference but my trophy count is 3727, on Supreme ranked Blot, in the mythic league(orange) triple bullet rank in top 3, at village map. Sadly I died in a crossfire from 2 teams before I could figure out if I could equip the default visor.
